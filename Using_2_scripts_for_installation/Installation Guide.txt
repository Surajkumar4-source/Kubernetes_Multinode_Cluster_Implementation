1. Save the script as install_master_node.sh on the master node.
2. Replace <master_node_IP> with the actual IP address of your master node in the kubeadm init command.
3. Run the script:

sudo bash install_master_node.sh

Copy the join command displayed at the end. You'll need this to connect the worker nodes.





--------------------Instructions for Worker Node Script------------------------


1. Save the script as install_worker_node.sh on each worker node.
2. Run the script:

sudo bash install_worker_node.sh

3. When prompted, enter the join command obtained from the master node setup.





-------------Summary of Steps-------------

## On the Master Node:

Run install_master_node.sh.
Copy the join command.

## On Each Worker Node:

Run install_worker_node.sh.
Enter the join command when prompted.
With these scripts, youâ€™ll have a Kubernetes cluster configured with a master node and multiple worker nodes!
